// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called name and set it equal to 'Dane' as a string variable.
// Then we check if Name is equal to or an (exact match) to 'Mary. If it is, we console.log( 'Hi, Mary!' )
// if it is not equal to or a true statement, then we console.log("How do you do?")
//We run the code and it is not a true statement, we console.log("How do you do?")

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We want to find out the value of variable secret and we make a variable called code and set it to 123 as a number
// We check if code is exactly equal to 123, and if it is we set the value for variable secret to "super" and multiply value for code by 2
// Code is now 246. We check if code is greater than 250, if it is, secret is now 'duper'. 
//but it is not. secret still equals super. We console.log(secret)

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called isStudent and set it to true, make a variable called age set it to 34 (number), and var zip and set it to 55407.
// We check if var isStudent is true AND var zip is greater then 80000. If so, console.log "You're a student on the West Coast"
// We check if var isStudent is false OR var age is less than 30. If so, console.log "What are your hobbies?"
// We check if var isStudent is true. If so, console.log "Welcome to Prime".
//If none of those is true, we console log. "How about the weather?". 
// isStudent is true so we console.log "Welcome to prime".



//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);

  console.log('What are your hobbies?');

  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
// FIX - The variables are set to the wrong values, they're inversed.
// Should be: let colorOne = 'blue';
//            let colorTwo = 'red';
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
// FIX - There is a missing variable. Only one variable is declared.
// missing: colorTwo = 'purple';
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
// FIX - instructions don't say anything about time being a constant and time hasn't been declared before.
// should be: let time = 4;
const time = 4;

// FIX - wrong syntax. Instructions say AND (&&) but code for OR (||) was used
// Should be - if (temp > 39 && time >= 4)
if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

if(minAge <= age) {
  //FIX - condition is correct. Both console logs are inversed. console.log is incorrect. Instructions say if minAge is less than age, you can enter
  // should be: console.log('enter)
  console.log('no entry');

// FIX - console.log is incorrect
// should be: console.log('no entry')
} else {
  console.log('enter');
